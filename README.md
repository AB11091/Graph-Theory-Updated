# Graph-Theory-Updated

This repository needs to be cloned (i.e. not a remote connection) to be run locally.

# How To:

You will be presented with a sort of 'canvas' and a text box

In the text box, you will enter a graph in the following format:

- It must be an adjacency list format, where the adjacency list of each node is separated by '|'.
- between |'s, the first character represents a node, and the remaining characters  (separated by a space) represent adjacent nodes.
- the 'name' for each node can only be one character long, excluding 'l', 'm', and ' ' (space).

For example, the following input: 1 2 3|2 1 4 5 6|3 1 6|4 2 7|5 2 7|6 2 3|7 4 5
Creates this graph.
